# Asteroid Gauntlet

This is a game I made as a final project for a college class. Recently rebuilt in React and animated with HTML Cavnas, the Objective reads: "You're piloting a rescue ship responding to an emergency transmission from a nearby asteroid field. Do your best to collect as many lifepods as you can but be careful, the further you venture the more difficult it'll become."
